Generally, entities marked with `\"edition\": \"one\"` will not be modified (as they are assumed to be up-to-date) prior to display/use, and entities lacking an `\"edition\"` or using `\"edition\": \"classic\"` may be modified to better suit modern rules. For example:\n- Classes/subclasses: an edition mismatch between class and subclass will prompt the renderer to add a note that the subclass is from a different game edition, and that feature levels may have to be adjusted accordingly (notably, when rendering synthetic subclass copies)\n- Plutonium, when using the \"Modern (2024)\" rules version: non-\"one\" species will be stripped of their ability scores; non-\"one\" backgrounds will gain extra ability scores; etc.",
